This to do list allows to create, edit, and delete tasks and projects. Before creating a task you have to make sure that there is at least one existing project because every task has to be linked to a project. You can not create a task and not have it linked to a project. If you are going to link a task to a specific project, make sure that project exists first. 

The data in this simple app is stored in the user's browser. In other words, localStorage is used. Whenever the browser is refreshed, the data (i.e. projects and tasks will not be deleted). The three squares at the bottom of the viewport are used to drag and drop tasks based on their current status. For instance, if a task has been completed, then you can moved it to its respective box or square and its status will change automatically.
